<h2 id="1">The First Computers<a href="#Begin"></a></h2>

<p>
    If we look at a large time scale, we can say that the first computers were invented in Mesopotamia hundreds of years before Christ, such as the abacus. However, I will direct the discussion to the MARK 1 electromechanical computer invented in 1944 to perform mathematical calculations. According to the scientists, the machine allowed mathematical calculations to be done more quickly. 
    In addition, we can mention the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) which was built by electrical engineers and was also an electromechanical computer and allowed 2 year calculations to be done in 2 hours. 
    Furthermore , ENIAC was widely used to calculate missile ballistics routes .

<h2 id="2">How the Internet was Born<a href="#Begin"></a></h2>
<p>

    We can say that the internet appeared in 1969 with the ARPPANET where it had the first connection between Stanford and UCLA computers.
    . In the early 70s, the word Internet was born, which was applied to the system of interconnected networks through the TCP and IP protocols (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) on which they based Internet services and e-mails and
    in 1990 Tim Berners-Lee created the language HTML (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).

        <li><strong>i :</strong> This tag is used to make a word italicized.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>a :</strong> This tag is very important in HTML , because with it we can add hyperlinks , images and videos on the Webpage . In summary this tag is fundamentals because it allowed the navigation on the Website.</li>
